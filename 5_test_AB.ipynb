       "   'text': 'Sometimes when I hear an A-list cast will be bunched up together for 2 hours in a movie I hope, and pray that it is good, not for the sake of my 10 bucks or 2 hours, but for the sake of these actors careers. In the case of Be Cool, everything went to waste.In the beginning of the film John Travolta (aka Chili Palmer) and a music executive played by James Woods are driving in a car talking about movie sequels, and how most arent good. If you look passed the fact that this scene was shot the same way Quentin Tarrantino filmed his car scene in Pulp Fiction, and listen to the dialogue you cant help but ponder whether this is 1) a disclaimer to the audience that this movie is going to suck, or 2) an attempt to get the audience laughing at the sheer humor of 2 people talking about sequels in a sequel. Oh the irony! (In case you were wondering, choice 1 is correct.) The cool and slick Chili Palmer from the first and good film Get Shorty is revived to play a mobster gone music business pro. He steals a young hot singer (Christina Milian) from her ghetto pimped out Jewish manager (Vince Vaughn), and turns her into a singing sensation. Of course a movie about an ex-mobster can never be complete without new mobsters causing havoc. This time around the mobsters of choice are Russian, played by American actors who cannot act Russian if my entire family hit them upside the head with their Russian bare hands.As a Russian I wasnt so much offended by the way this film portrayed Russians, but instead as a writer I was more offended by the horrible dialogue. This film tried too hard to get the audience to laugh. It turned potentially good lines into a redundancy. The Russian, black, and gay jokes were the same ones only reworded a couple of hundred times. After calling The Rocks character a f***** (he plays a gay bodyguard to Vince Vaughn), and Cedric the Entertainerers character a n***** (he played a black rapper with an entourage who threaten those who dont play his tracks with guns) I wanted to walk out of the movie theater, because it was painful to sit through. If this was Get Shorty none of this wouldve even needed to be in the film to build up drama, or a really bad laugh.What lacked in this film that didnt in Get Shorty was Chilis hot spicey attitude. Hes a completely different person in this sequel. For one thing the old Chili wouldve had more dialogue. John Travolta doesnt have more than 20 speaking lines in Be Cool, because he is out staged by the repetitive lines, and the hundred and two cameo appearances by the most random celebrities. I wont ruin the shock by revealing all of the cameos for those who actually plan to see this movie (PLEASE DONT!!!), but I will say that it will forever amaze me that these people agreed to be in a film of such inanity.What was even more stupid was the very lame dance sequence with Travolta and Uma Thurman (she plays the widower of James Woods who LUCKILY gets killed in the first 10 minutes of the movie). Tarrantino never made Pulp Fiction for an idiot like the director of Be Cool to mess around with. This dance number was boring, long, and just plain throbbing. The Black Eyed Peas playing in the club with a total of 10 people didnt make the scene any memorable.There were so many plot holes that I left the theater asking myself WHY?! Everything about this film was a big question mark. I just didnt understand the point to anything. I couldnt even explain to you why the Russians were after everyone, or why this film was ever made, because Im baffled. All I took out of this movie was that everyone in L.A. has a sidekick, and the only way this movie was probably funded was through all of the advertisements by Diet Coke, Yahoo!, Honda Insight Hybrid, T-Mobile, Trimspa (even the spokeswoman herself is in the movie) and the Bad Screenwriters Guild. Plot holes, stupid dialogue, too many random cameos, horrible acting (even by the pros), and a not-so-entertaining attempt to mimic Pulp Fiction makes this film the worst movie of 2005, and its only the third month of the year.',\n",

       "   'text': 'Connors boost for British tennis\\n\\nFormer world number one Jimmy Connors is planning a long-term relationship with the Lawn Tennis Association to help unearth the next Tim Henman.\\n\\nThe American spent three days at the LTAs annual Elite Performance winter camp in La Manga earlier this week. Britain has the right attitude, said Connors. The more involved I can be with the LTA, the better. A short-term arrangement is just confusing. The kids will ask: What am I doing there? LTA chief executive, John Crowther, added: The relationship that Jimmys already started to develop with the coaches and the players has said to us that wed like some more of it. We want to use Jimmy for a number of weeks a year and we hope this is the beginning of a good long-term relationship.\\n\\nThe camp played host to more than 30 leading senior and junior players, including Greg Rusedski, Arvind Parmar and Anne Keothavong. La Manga is an amazing site to take a bunch of kids who want to be the best, said Connors, speaking at Queens Club in London. What impressed me most was not only the coaches but the way the kids went about their workouts and the feeling they put into every practice they had. It was interesting to me to see kids of 15, 16, 17, with that desire and passion, and that can only be brought about by the coaches surrounding them. Instilling the importance of work and practice is something you cant buy. They know whats been given to them and all they have to do is give back the effort, and every minute of practice they were doing that.\\n\\nSpeaking from La Manga, LTA performance director David Felgate told BBC Sport: Jimmy was fantastic with the players and the coaches, and very humble considering what hes achieved. He worked through the coaches and hopefully it will grow and hell get to have more of an individual relationship with some of the players and get to know them. He made it clear from the word go he didnt want it to be short-term. This is a 52-week-a-year job for me, its my life and my passion and its the same with the coaches. He respects that but he wants to be involved and have real input. And why would he stake his reputation on something thats not going to be successful? Connors has also agreed to commentate for the BBC at next years Wimbledon Championships. He will work during the second week of the tournament.\\n',\n",

       "   'text': 'Mauresmo opens with victory in LA\\n\\nAmelie Mauresmo and Maria Sharapova won their opening matches at the Tour Championships in Los Angeles.\\n\\nFrances Mauresmo routed Vera Zvonareva 6-1 6-0, while Wimbledon champion Sharapova was a 6-1 6-4 winner over fellow Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova. American Serena Williams also won, edging Russian Elena Dementieva 7-6 7-5 for her second victory of the event. The event is split into two groups of four with the top two from each advancing to the semi-finals.\\n\\nMauresmos win was her ninth in a row as she tries to overtake Lindsay Davenport for the number one spot. Mauresmo spent five weeks at number one after the US Open before injury ushered Davenport back in front. Since then, I feel very confident on court and my game is there. I want to get the ranking back, but its very different than before I was number one. It was an obsession, but now I take it in a relaxed way. Mauresmo completed her first match in the season-ending championship in 54 minutes as Russias Zvonareva struggled to return her serve and failed to achieve a single break point.\\n\\nShe got mad a little bit and I played some great tennis, said Mauresmo, who was runner-up to Kim Clijsters in last years final. Zvonareva has lost both her games so far, having crashed 6-2 6-4 Kuznetsova in the Staples Centre on Wednesday. Sometimes not everything works, she said. It was lots of pressure. Maybe that is why I couldnt do 100%. But I was fighting. Sharapova, who lost 6-2 6-2 to Kuznetsova in Beijing in September, said: In Beijing, she was coming off such a big winning streak [14 matches] and she was unstoppable. This time, it was important to start off well and put some pressure on her. The tournament debutant added: I love it here. The atmosphere is great. To be here where the Lakers play, you just feel that excitement. I love basketball. Williams admitted she is still some way off her best form but remained positive after two wins in two days. Its hard to go out there and get it right but Im fighting and Im hoping, said Williams. What makes me happy is the effort. I had a really good effort today. Im trying to add new dimensions to my game.\\n',\n",

       "   'text': '2004: An Irish Athletics Year\\n\\n2004 wont be remembered as one of Irish athletics great years.\\n\\nThe year began with that optimism which invariably and unaccountably, seems to herald an upcoming Olympiad. But come late August, a few hot days in the magnificent stadium in Athens told us of the true strength of Irish athletics - or to be more accurate, the lack of it. Sonia OSullivans Olympic farewell apart, there was little to stir the emotions of Irish athletics watchers. But after the disastrous build-up to the games, we shouldnt have been surprised. At the start of the year, an OSullivan had been earmarked as Irelands best medal prospect but as it turned out, walker Gillian never even made it to the start line because of injury. Less than a week before the Olympics, the sport was rocked by news that 10,000m hope Cathal Lombard had tested for the banned substance EPO. Lombards shattering of Mark Carrolls national 10,000m record in April had already set tongues wagging but even the most cynical of observers, were surprised when he was rumbled after an Irish Sports Council sting operation. The Corkman quickly held his hands up in admission and was promptly handed a two-year ban from the sport.\\n\\nBack at pre-Olympic ranch in Greece, it must have seemed that things couldnt have got any worse but they very nearly did with walker Jamie Costin lucky to escape with his life after being involved in a car crash near Athens. Once the track and field action began in Athens, a familiar pattern of underachievement emerged although Alistair Craggs performance in being the only athlete from a European nation to qualify for the 5,000m final did offer hope for the future. Our beloved Sonia scraped into the womens 5K final as a fastest loser and for a couple of days, the country attempted to delude itself into believing that she might be in the medal shake-up. As it happened, she went out the back door early in the final although there was nothing undignified about the way that she insisted on finishing the race over a minute behind winner Meseret Defar. It later transpired that Sonia had been suffering from a stomach bug in the 48 hours before the final although typically, the Cobhwoman played down the effects of the illness. Amazingly, she was back in action a couple of weeks later when beating a world-class field at the Flora Lite 5K road race in London and while her major championship days may be over, its unlikely that we have seen the last of her in competition. At least Sonia managed to make it to Athens. At the start of the year, several Northern Ireland athletes had genuine hopes of qualifying for the Games but come August, an out-of-form and injured Paul Brizzel was the lone standard bearer for the province. The Ballymena man gave it a lash but his achilles problem, and a bad lane draw, meant a time of 21.00 and an early exit.\\n\\nJames McIlroy, Gareth Turnbull, Zoe Brown and Paul McKee all had to be content with watching the Athens action on their television screens. 800m hope McIlroy never got near his best during the summer and a fourth place in the British trials effectively ended his hopes of making the plane. The injury-plagued Turnbull gamely travelled round Europe in search of the 1500m qualifying mark but 3:39 was the best he could achieve, after missing several months training during the previous winter. A lingering hamstring probem and a virus wrecked McKees Athens ambitions and both he and Turnbull deserve a slice of better fortune in 2005. Pole vaulter Brown had hoped for a vote of confidence from the British selectors after she had achieved the Athens B standard but the call never came. As the summer ended, stalwarts Catherina McKiernan and Dermot Donnelly hung up their competitive spikes. McKiernan had to candidly acknowledge that time had crept up on her after several injury-ravaged years. Donnelly and his Annadale Striders team-mates later suffered tragedy when their friend and clubman Andy Campbell was found dead at his home on 18 December. A large turnout of athletics-loving folk turned out in west Belfast to offer their respects to the Campbell family and Andys many friends. As only death can, it put the years athletics happenings in a sharp perspective.\\n',\n",

The German-born Vaidisova rallied well at times but was unable to find a way back after falling behind 3-2 in the opening set. Davenport, who closed out with an ace, plays Karolina Sprem in the next round. I was fully expecting a tough opponent and was able to play well enough to get through it, said Davenport.

After a tough first set, Molik grew in confidence and won in just 56 minutes. She will now meet Venus Williams. Bring it on, said the 23-year-old. I played pretty well and it was nice to get through in straight sets. We were destined to meet, I guess, Williams said referring to her match with Molik. It will be a huge match for her in Australia.

       "   'text': 'Keegan hails comeback king Fowler\\n\\nManchester City boss Kevin Keegan has praised striker Robbie Fowler for his landmark return to form.\\n\\nThe 29-year-old, out of favour at City earlier this season, took his Premiership goal tally past 150 with a brace in Mondays 3-2 win at Norwich. He is still a quality player and knows where the net is - we have just got to supply him with ammunition and, in the end, we did, Keegan said. He has worked hard to get back to where he is now. The former Liverpool striker, who moved to City in 2003 after a poor stint at Leeds, has battled back into first-team contention after struggling with fitness at the start of the season.\\n\\nFowler overtook Les Ferdinand on Tuesday evening to become the third highest scorer of all time in the Premiership, with 151 goals, and he only trails Alan Shearer (250) and Andy Cole (173). And Keegan believes there is still more to come from the former England forward. He can get better if we can supply him better, added Keegan. People want to write him off but if he has kept the articles of those people who have written him off he could throw them back at them and they would be left with a bit of egg on their face. Fowlers double strike helped City come back from two goals down to clinch a dramatic win at Carrow Road and Keegan sympathised with Norwich boss Nigel Worthington afterwards. I feel a bit for Nigel Worthington, he said. His team have got great character, they have a lot of drive and enthusiasm. I know it is a killer blow for Norwich but I really think they have brought something to the Premiership. The stadium and the atmosphere is great, it is just a tough league to stay in - as they are finding out and as we know.\\n',\n",
